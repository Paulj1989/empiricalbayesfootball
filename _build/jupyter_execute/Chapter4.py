# # Hypothesis Testing, FDR
# 
# Now, it's time to take a look at hypothesis testing. Using posterior error probability (PEP), we answer the burning question that we have always wanted to answer in our lifetime : are Messi and Ronaldo elite at shot conversion ?

# Let's say a conversion percent of 11 is the pre-requisite to get inducted into the Shot Conversion Hall of Fame. Using the posterior distribution for each player, we can see that each of them have a non-zero probability that shot conversion is less than 0.11, or 11%. Let's look at an example to clarify the point.

# Now we will talk about False Discovery Rate or FDR. We ask the question : how many players can be safely inducted into the Shot Conversion Hall of Fame ? By safely, we actually mean : at max only a certain % of the players inducted into the Hall of Fame would be present there erroneously. This percentage could be 5 % , ie., only about 5% of the players were included falsely. We can do this by calculating q-value, which is the mean PEP of the players included into the Hall of Fame. By doing a cumulative mean(including all players one by one incrementally), we can get a full plot of qvalue threshold and number of players included at that threshold. If our q-value threshold is small, like 5%, we can only include a few players, but if its 25%, a lot more players can be included (albeit at the cost that about 25% of those inclusions are probably erroneous).
